# Pearl Jam Analysis in R
## Musical and lyrical analysis of Pearl Jam's songs

This repository comprises a musical and lyrical analysis of Pearl Jam's songs. I use data from Spotify's and Genius's APIs. I use scripts to query information on the musical propety of all of the 11 Pearl Jam albums. I later use a script to scrape the lyrycs to several songs and finally use the Genius API to download the remaining. Related works include [Kendrick Lamar sentiment analysis](https://github.com/davidklaing/kendrick/blob/master/README.md), [Gloom Index](https://www.rcharlie.com/blog/fitter-happier/) to find Radiohead's most depressing song by [Charlie Thompson](https://www.rcharlie.com), [Bob Dylan lyrical analysis](https://rpubs.com/paul_reiners/406359) by Paul Reiners, [tidy sentiment analysis](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-R) on Prince's music by Debbie Liske and [Musical Lyrics Analysis](https://rpubs.com/BreeMcLennan/music_lyric_analysis) on several artists by Bree McLennan.

The repo is organized as follows:


* ***Data Assessment***
  + ***Intellectual Property (Copyrigths)***
  + ***Songs selection: Spotify API***
  + ***Lyrics: Scraping and using the Genius API***
  + ***Processing the lyrics***
