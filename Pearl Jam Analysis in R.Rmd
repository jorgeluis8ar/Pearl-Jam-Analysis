# Pearl Jam Analysis in R
## Musical and lyrical analysis of Pearl Jam's songs

This repository comprises a musical and lyrical analysis of Pearl Jam's songs. I use data from Spotify's and Genius's APIs. I use scripts to query information on the musical propety of all of the 11 Pearl Jam albums. I later use a script to scrape the lyrycs to several songs and finally use the Genius API to download the remaining. Related works include [Kendrick Lamar sentiment analysis](https://github.com/davidklaing/kendrick/blob/master/README.md), [Gloom Index](https://www.rcharlie.com/blog/fitter-happier/) to find Radiohead's most depressing song by [Charlie Thompson](https://www.rcharlie.com), [Bob Dylan lyrical analysis](https://rpubs.com/paul_reiners/406359) by Paul Reiners, [tidy sentiment analysis](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sentiment-analysis-R) on Prince's music by Debbie Liske and [Musical Lyrics Analysis](https://rpubs.com/BreeMcLennan/music_lyric_analysis) on several artists by Bree McLennan.

The repo is organized as follows:


* ***Data Assessment***
  + ***Intellectual Property (Copyrigths)***
  + ***Songs selection: Spotify API***
  + ***Lyrics: Scraping and using the Genius API***
  + ***Processing the lyrics***
  + ***Final Data set***

* ***Data exploration***
  + ***Word counts by album and song***
  + ***Wordclouds***
  + ***Vocabulary diversity***
  + ***Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)***

* ***Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing***
  + ***NCR Sentiment***
  + ***Bi-grams***
  
# Data Assessment
## Intellectual Property (Copyrigths)

I would like to acknowledge that every single content exposed in this repository is based on protected songs. All the rigths of the data used come from the Spotify API, Genius API, but mainly the sonwriters and composers of the songs. In no way it is intented to make it as my own. All the mistakes made are my own and no one else.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
